## Tile Generation
This lab was a practice in using QMetaTiles a QGIS plugin that allows you to download map tiles. Using Mapbox and WTMS connections I downloaded tiles of four different basemaps, and included a semantic layer that represents picnic table spots in Seattle. Using this method I can host my own tiles on my Github repo, without needing to make a call to the Mapbox API.

All four map tile collections are set to show the greater Seattle area.

### Map 1: Blueprint

Blueprint is a mapbox basemap that was collected from the Mapbox Studio gallery.
